  Hello. I'm Ben, a digital leader, working for TPXimpact. This is my corner of the internet, where I will post things about work and life.
</p>

## Work

I've spent my [non-linear career](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/03/18/why-non-linear-careers-are-the-future-of-work/) with teams building great products and services in the public sector.

Most recently I've been doing this with TPXimpact and my clients at MHCLG and the MOJ. Before that I've had a wonderful time creating the conditions for user-centred design and digital delivery at Essex, Buckinghamshire, FutureGov, the Home Office and a few others.

## Life

I live in Buckinghamshire with my partner and our children.

I have distant memories of being a [decent triathlete](https://triathlon.org/athletes/profile/30776/ben-unsworth). I can still just about call myself a [runner](https://www.runbritainrankings.com/runners/profile.aspx?athleteid=245125) and a cyclist. I'm far more likely to be seen jogging around parkrun with my kids.

I've picked up a skateboard again, which has been a great way to meet some other middle aged folks who used to skate. It's also fun to join in with my kids.

  There are way too many dads trying to stay young and cool by skateboarding and listening to Kendrick Lamar.
