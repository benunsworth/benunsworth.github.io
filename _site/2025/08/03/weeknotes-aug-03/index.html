  <h2 id="what-ive-been-doing">What I’ve been doing</h2>

<p>I’ve handed over almost everything now, so enjoyed a week with some space in the diary.</p>

<p>Had a couple of handover chats with the person who’s holding the interim role for my new job. Helpful to get a headstart on this so we can make the most of the few days where we will overlap. I’ve come up with a useful set of questions that I will tidy up and share at some point.</p>

<p>Had a shared leaving drinks with a colleague. Nice and low-key pub chats definitely my preffered style of send off.</p>

<p>Put the finishing touches on a few statements of work for the Ministry of Justice. I will be sad to leave this work behind. It’s been amazing to work on something with such a direct link to impact. The blended TPX and MOJ teams have done a remarkable amount of work in 3 months. Unfortunately not my stories to tell just yet, but seeing something go from a raw prototype to private beta in 6 weeks has been a career highlight.</p>

<p>Had a call with Andrew Webb at Essex County Council. Really lovely to catch up and bounce some ideas around.</p>

<p>Finished the week by chatting to Dr Jaqui Taylor about open (data) standards. Something I’ve been fortunate to continue championing through our work with MHCLG.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-need-to-take-care-of">What I need to take care of</h2>

<p>A little more admin before our drive to the Alps. Crit Air sticker has arrived, high vis vests purchased, warning triangle located, GB sticker applied, headlamp sticker ordered, V5 and proof of insurance in the glovebox.</p>

<p>I’ve fitted a now functioning downstairs WC and some double glazing panes being replaced next week. I <em>just</em> need to fit out the utility room and we’re nearly ready to get this house on the market.</p>

<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18335752/">1923</a> is streaming on Netflix. Plugging some gaps in the Yellowstone lore. Goodness me Montana is beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81928921">WWE Unreal</a> also on Netflix. Very polished docu-series as part of WWE’s move to Netflix. Feels like it spells the end of (<em>kayfabe</em>)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe], but I am here for it. Not quite as good as Drive to Survive of TDF Unchained, but good background TV.</p>

<p>8 out of 10 cats does countdown. Bob Mortimer and Richard Ayoade as team captains should be unstoppable TV, but the first episode of the new series felt a bit strained. Hope it gets better.</p>
