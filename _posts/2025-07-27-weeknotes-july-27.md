title: Weeknotes 21st to 27th July
---

Jukesie's [Nostalgia Act Era](https://digitalbydefault.com/2025/06/15/my-nostalgia-act-era/) has been a good kick up the backside for my stop-start relationship with blogging. Or at least personal blogging and writing things down on the internet under my own website.

Weeknotes are a great way to get back into the habit. Giles Turnbull has written down [what they are, how they work and how to start your own](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/index.html). A few of the folks whose notes I read:

* [Ann Kempster](https://blog.annkempster.com/) - delivery, strategy, gardening, Wales
* [Neil Williams](https://neilojwilliams.net/) - ex-GOV.UK, now at BFI, internet, culture, Crystal Palace
* [Sharon O'Dea](https://sharonodea.com/blog/) - digital, workplace, employee experience, comms, Amsterdam
* [Ben Holliday](https://benholliday.com/) - 20 years of blog posts on design adn digital
* [Matt Edgar](https://blog.mattedgar.com/) - Digital and Design in the NHS

## What I've been doing

Handing over. 

I'm moving on from TPXimpact. I've got about two weeks left and have mostly handed over to a colleague. I've found the right job in the right place (more on this in a week or so), so leaving a little earlier than planned.

Leaving the work with one of our major new clients in a good spot. The teams are happy, delivering well and we can see how the work will make a real impact on outcomes. 

A bit of admin writing new statements of work before I sign off and give back the laptop.

## What I need to take care of

Mostly life admin. Off to France in two weeks time, passports have all just arrived (gotta love the excellent and FAST passports service).

Doing all the jobs in the house to get it ready to sell. New job will mean moving back to South West London / Surrey.

## What I've been inspired by

Juksie and the associated buzz around the [power, peril and privilege of working in the open.](https://digitalbydefault.com/2025/07/03/camp-digital-2025-working-in-the-open/) It was enough to get me past playing with static site generators (you can read about this on the [about](https://benunsworth.co.uk/about/)page) and posting content.
