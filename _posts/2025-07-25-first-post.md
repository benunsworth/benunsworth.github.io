The first post on a new blog is mostly about just starting. I've spent a lot of the last 15+ years creating the conditions for teams to think out loud and work in the open.

I've not great at consistently doing this myself. 

There have been periods where I've strung together a series of posts about [leading a team building digital services for a new unitary council](https://medium.com/buckinghamshire-digital-service/buckinghamshire-council-website-weeknote-20-69a77878fd19) or [getting back into triathlon](https://medium.com/@benunsworth/the-12-week-sub-10-in-10-hours-training-plan-140c594b66f9).

My magnum opus was a post about [building a shed](https://medium.com/@benunsworth/building-a-shed-you-can-work-from-home-in-acd45621abdf).

A few things have happened to make me post this [shitty first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) on the internet:

* A new job, back in the public sector, starting at the end of August
* Jukesie's [nostalgia act era](https://digitalbydefault.com/2025/06/15/my-nostalgia-act-era/) and [recent talk at Camp Digital: The power, peril and privilege of working in the open](https://youtu.be/Rm8jZJWSvNM?feature=shared)
* Other people's posts continue to be a source of fun, help and inspiration
